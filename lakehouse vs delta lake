📄 FINAL NOTEPAD STYLE — COMPLETE COMBINED NOTES
====================================================
1. Databricks BEFORE Lakehouse Architecture

Pure Spark-based analytics platform

No unified architecture

Data stored in Parquet/CSV/JSON

No ACID transactions

No time travel

Storage became “data swamp” easily

Limited SQL capabilities

No Medallion architecture

Hive Metastore optional and limited

Governance through basic ACLs and cloud IAM

Harder for BI workloads, batch-focused

No native data warehouse layer

====================================================
2. Databricks AFTER Lakehouse Architecture Introduced

Delta Lake introduced → ACID, time travel, schema enforcement

Lakehouse = Data Lake + Data Warehouse unified

Medallion architecture (Bronze/Silver/Gold) standardized

High performance SQL (SQL Warehouse)

Supports ETL, ML, Streaming, BI on same platform

Better reliability through Delta

Storage + compute decoupled

Large-scale workloads possible

Governance improved but still workspace-level

Hive Metastore still used as catalog

====================================================
3. Databricks WITH Lakehouse (Before Unity Catalog)

Still used Hive Metastore → per workspace

Metadata isolated per workspace

No cross-workspace table sharing

Permissions fragmented:

Table ACLs

Cloud IAM

Cluster ACLs

Notebook ACLs

No column-level or row-level security

No lineage features

Sharing data required giving storage paths

Data reliability good (Delta), governance weak

Large enterprises struggled with multi-workspace management

No centralized catalog at account level

====================================================
4. Databricks WITH Lakehouse AND Unity Catalog

Central account-level governance

Single Unity Metastore for all workspaces

Catalog → Schema → Table hierarchy

Strong security features:

Row-level filtering

Column masking

Attribute-based access control

Full lineage: table + column-level

Delta Sharing enabled for simple internal/external sharing

Managed locations and storage credentials

Standardized data access across workspaces

Unified permissions for tables, notebooks, jobs, models

Strong compliance (HIPAA, PCI, SOX, etc.)

Fully governed Lakehouse end-to-end

Easier to scale for large organizations

====================================================
5. Delta Lake vs. Lakehouse (Short Points)

Delta Lake

Storage format + ACID transaction layer

Adds reliability to data lake

Provides time travel & schema enforcement

Works on ADLS/S3/GCS

Subsystem inside the Lakehouse

Lakehouse

Entire architecture combining Lake + Warehouse

Uses Delta Lake as storage foundation

Includes SQL, ML, BI, governance, lineage

Overall system, not just storage

Summary

Delta Lake = technology

Lakehouse = architecture

Delta Lake is part of the Lakehouse (not separate)

====================================================
6. Unity Catalog vs. Lakehouse (Short Points)

Unity Catalog

Central governance + metadata layer

Row/column-level security

Cross-workspace access

Lineage, auditing, delta sharing

Subsystem inside the Lakehouse

Lakehouse

Full data platform with storage, compute, governance

Unity Catalog is the governance engine inside it

Summary

Unity Catalog = governance subsystem

Lakehouse = architecture

Unity Catalog is not separate, it enhances the Lakehouse

====================================================
7. Classification: Subsystems vs. Separate Things

Subsystems of Lakehouse:

Delta Lake (storage reliability)

Unity Catalog (governance + metadata)

SQL Warehouse

ML Runtime

Photon Engine

Orchestration (Jobs)

Separate Concepts:

Lakehouse itself = overarching architecture

Hive Metastore (older governance system)

====================================================
